#"Disposable Software Architecture"

I have been coming to believe that designing software for the future should not necessarily define some sort of ideal target end state but rather an end state where it is disposed...

Most of the time applications do not reach their ideal architectural target state defined at its initial design, the target is changing along the way and reaching end state usually ends up as a state where the application is hard to retrofit for new (unforeseen) requirements. Many applications will eventually become monolithic and technically dated, the original team probably believed to have created a design that should prevented a hard to change application, but in time that team went on and subsequent teams broke the misunderstood software patterns and the dated technology starts to impose its limitations. What usually happens next is that the application becomes too complex and thus expensive to maintain and change, the main problem is that this conclusion is always discovered too late, what follows is a painful period of expensive and long change management until the initiative for a total rewrite in a newer technology arrives.

One of the architectural principles applied to software design should include the disposal-ability of the design, thus accepting an end state that the application needs to be re-written at a pre-determined point in time. The result will be that when the design incorporates this exit strategy, modularity boundaries will be better defined in order to determine how the application can be decomposed for retirement. Another benefit of knowing when the application is going to be disposed is that design decisions can be tailored to where about the application is in it life cycle. You might for example consider for more tactical (read: cheaper) approaches when getting closer to end of the application's life cycle (and still feel good about it).

It is key that organizationally this architecture needs to be understood and supported, the business might struggle when a solution is proposed to build a system that is going to be disposed at date X. However I think it is easier to sell a well planned exit strategy upfront opposed to explain that you need one by the time they are excited to introduce a new ambitious project.

Thanks for reading and have a great week,
